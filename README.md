#### How to run the project ####

2) Go to browser and run the project


#### Approch #####
1) I have downloaded the codeigniter-3 and rename the folder to project name
2) Then I create the controller and the view to be render
3) include the cdn link for Jquery and bootstrap files.
4) I used Ajax for consume the API and then put the result set in render page
