####Used Technology####
#PHP Codeigniter Framework(MVC Framework) for Server side render
#HTML and JQuery for Frontend
#Ajax for consume API
#Bootstrap4 for responsive design

####How to run the project####
#Need to download the project folder(clone from github) and put in the htdocs(in windows) or /var/www/html/(in Linux)
#Go to browser and run the project


####Approch#####
#I have downloaded the codeigniter-3 and rename the folder to project name
#Then I create the controller and the view to be render
#include the cdn link for Jquery and bootstrap files.
#I used Ajax for consume the API and then put the result set in render page

#I have done the testing for responsive design correctness.

#Finally commit the code in Github
